# Claude Code Hooks for Workflow Enforcement

Ready-to-drop `settings.json` hook recipes that enforce the critical rules from `SKILL.md` at tool-invocation time. These run in the Claude Code harness, not in git — they catch violations before the command executes.

For git-side hooks (pre-commit, pre-push), see `references/git-hooks-setup.md` instead.

## Where to put these

| Scope | File | When to use |
|-------|------|-------------|
| Personal, all projects | `~/.claude/settings.json` | Enforce your own rules everywhere |
| Team, committed to repo | `.claude/settings.json` | Enforce team rules for this project |
| Personal, one project | `.claude/settings.local.json` | Overrides for this project only |

Merge carefully — read the existing `hooks:` block, add to arrays, never replace wholesale.

## Recipe 1: Block `gh pr merge` When Review Threads Are Open

Blocks any `gh pr merge` invocation that would merge a PR with unresolved review threads or a non-CLEAN merge state.

The merge-gate logic is non-trivial, so it ships as an external script — `scripts/merge-gate.sh` in this skill — rather than inline JSON. Install it and reference it:

```bash
cp <skill>/scripts/merge-gate.sh ~/.claude/hooks/merge-gate.sh
chmod +x ~/.claude/hooks/merge-gate.sh
```

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "PreToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "Bash",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "if": "Bash(gh pr merge *)",
            "command": "~/.claude/hooks/merge-gate.sh"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```


The hook denies `gh pr merge` when review threads are unresolved or `mergeStateStatus != CLEAN` (`UNSTABLE` — a non-required check red — is still a deny). It deliberately does not gate on `reviewDecision`: repos without a required-approval rule report `""` and merge legitimately when CLEAN. It parses the three PR-reference forms `gh pr merge` accepts (plain number — with long/short and `=`-joined flags before it — full URL, `owner/repo#N`), paginates the thread list, and honors an explicit `--repo`/`-R` flag — without that, the PR number resolves against the CWD repo and produces false denials when the command targets another repo. If parsing or the PR lookup fails, the hook allows the call rather than producing false-positive denies. Two usage caveats: the hook evaluates at Bash-call time, so never chain a wait-until-CLEAN loop and the merge in one invocation (wait in one call, merge in the next); and it is a personal-harness gate — server-side branch protection remains the authoritative enforcement.

## Recipe 2: Reject Edits to Installed Cache Paths

Prevents `Write` / `Edit` / `MultiEdit` from targeting `~/.claude/skills/...`, `~/.claude/plugins/cache/...`, or any `.bare/` path — which would be silently clobbered on the next update.

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "PreToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "Write|Edit|MultiEdit",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "jq -r '.tool_input.file_path // \"\"' | { read -r P; case \"$P\" in */.claude/skills/*|*/.claude/plugins/cache/*|*/.claude/plugins/marketplaces/*|*/.bare/*) echo \"{\\\"hookSpecificOutput\\\":{\\\"hookEventName\\\":\\\"PreToolUse\\\",\\\"permissionDecision\\\":\\\"deny\\\",\\\"permissionDecisionReason\\\":\\\"cache path rejected: $P — edit the source worktree instead\\\"}}\";; esac; }"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## Recipe 3: Warn on Unauthorized Squash

Does not block — just emits a warning. Squash is legitimate on repos with a squash policy; full blocking would be too noisy. The warning is enough to prompt the user to confirm intent.

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "PreToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "Bash",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "if": "Bash(gh pr merge *)",
            "command": "jq -r '.tool_input.command' | grep -qE -- '--squash\\b' && echo '{\"systemMessage\":\"⚠ squash merge requested — confirm the repo uses squash policy; default is atomic commits\"}' || true"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## Recipe 4: Auto-Lint Go Files After Write/Edit

Runs `golangci-lint` on the file's directory after any write. Silent-success; logs only on failure.

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "PostToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "Write|Edit|MultiEdit",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "jq -r '.tool_input.file_path // .tool_response.filePath // \"\"' | { read -r F; [ -z \"$F\" ] && exit 0; case \"$F\" in *.go) cd \"$(dirname \"$F\")\" && golangci-lint run --fast 2>&1 | head -40 || true;; esac; } 2>/dev/null"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Swap `golangci-lint` for your project's linter of choice. For PHP: `vendor/bin/php-cs-fixer fix --dry-run -- "$F"`. For JS/TS: `bunx eslint "$F"`.

## Recipe 5: Sentinel on "Verified" Claims Without Tool Output

Experimental — uses a `prompt` hook to audit assistant messages declaring pass/verified. Only runs on Stop events (end of assistant turn).

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "Stop": [
      {
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "prompt",
            "prompt": "Check the just-ended assistant turn. If it contains any of: 'verified', 'tested', 'all green', 'tests pass', 'should work now', 'try again' — AND no Bash/Read tool result in the same turn shows actual command output substantiating the claim — emit a systemMessage warning. Otherwise stay silent.\n\n$ARGUMENTS"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

This is a soft guardrail — the hook can't block a past message, only flag it to the user. Useful as a "you said tested but didn't run anything" reminder.

## Deploying Hooks

After editing `settings.json`:

```bash
# Validate JSON syntax first — broken JSON silently disables ALL settings
jq -e '.hooks' .claude/settings.json

# Reload config — open and close the /hooks menu in Claude Code, or restart
```

The settings watcher only picks up new hook files if `.claude/` existed at session start. If you created `.claude/settings.json` during a session, open `/hooks` once to reload.

## Recipe 6: Block `git commit` While Staged Content Has Conflict Markers

A resolver that exits non-zero does **not** stop a following `git add -A && git commit` in the same Bash call — the `&&` chain starts fresh after the failed command, so the commit lands with `<<<<<<<` in the tree and nothing reports it until a later gate run. `verify-git-workflow.sh` finds markers on demand; this denies the commit that would create them.

```bash
cp <skill>/scripts/conflict-marker-gate.py ~/.claude/hooks/
chmod +x ~/.claude/hooks/conflict-marker-gate.py
```

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "PreToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "Bash",
        "hooks": [
          { "type": "command", "command": "python3 $HOME/.claude/hooks/conflict-marker-gate.py" }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

It fires only when the command actually runs `git commit` (`git -C <dir> commit` and `git -c k=v commit` included) and only when staged blobs carry a marker. It matches `<<<<<<<` and `>>>>>>>` (each followed by a space) at line start but deliberately **not** a bare `=======`, which is an ordinary RST section underline and would otherwise deny every docs commit. Any error, non-repo cwd or unreadable diff allows the command — the gate never blocks on its own failure.

Verify it against both directions before relying on it: stage a file containing a real marker (must deny) and a `.rst` file with a `=======` underline (must allow).

## Recipe 7: Block a git write inside the reference `main/` worktree

`references/advanced-git.md` states that `main/` is reference only. The rule
gets broken anyway because breaking it needs no intent: one Bash call omits its
`cd`, inherits the working directory of an earlier call, and the commit lands on
the shared branch locally — where a later push or a `jj git export` moves it
under every sibling worktree. Prose cannot catch an inherited working directory;
a gate reads it out of the payload.

```bash
cp <skill>/scripts/reference-worktree-gate.py ~/.claude/hooks/
chmod +x ~/.claude/hooks/reference-worktree-gate.py
```

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "PreToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "Bash",
        "hooks": [
          { "type": "command", "command": "python3 $HOME/.claude/hooks/reference-worktree-gate.py" }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

It denies `commit`, `add`, `merge`, `rebase`, `cherry-pick`, `revert`, `am`,
`stash` and `reset --hard` when the effective directory is a `main/` (or
`master/`) that sits beside a `.bare`. It deliberately does **not** deny
`git -C <path> …` or a call that starts with `cd <path> &&` — both name where the
write lands, which is the shape it is steering toward — nor reads, `git fetch`,
or `git worktree add`, which are what the directory is for.

Nor `git merge --ff-only` / `git pull --ff-only`: the reference checkout has to
be *current* to serve as a base, so refreshing it is the directory's purpose and
a fast-forward can neither create a commit nor discard work. `reset --hard`
reaches the same state by discarding and stays refused. (That exemption is not
theory — the gate blocked its own author's `reset --hard` in `main/` minutes
after installation, which is how the over-block was found.) Roots default to
`~/projects` and `~/p`; set `GIT_WORKTREE_ROOTS` to a colon-separated list for
others.

Already have a Bash gate? Extend it instead of adding a second hook — the
directory test is three lines (`basename in {main,master}`, parent under a known
root, `.bare` sibling exists) and reusing one hook keeps the denial messages in
one place.

Verify both directions before relying on it: `python3 scripts/test_reference_worktree_gate.py`
builds a throwaway layout and checks that a commit in `main/` denies while
`git -C <branch> commit` and a commit in a branch worktree pass.

## Recipe 8: Deny a blanket `git add` while untracked files are lying around

Shipped in `scripts/validate_git_command.py` as `blanket_git_add()` (PreToolUse, Bash). `git add -A`, `git add --all` and `git add .` stage every untracked, non-ignored file in the tree; the rule "add the paths you changed by name" was written down and still violated — a `var/` DI-container cache (40k lines) rode into a commit and had to be amended and force-pushed out (2026-08-20). The gate reads the repository the command names (`git -C <dir>`) or the payload's `cwd`, asks `git status --porcelain --untracked-files=all`, and denies only when `??` entries exist, listing them. A clean tree, a tree with only tracked edits, a named path and `git add -u` pass. Escape hatch, shared with the destructive-git gate: `DESTRUCTIVE_GIT_GATE_OFF=1`. The deny message is the specification (see below): it names the files, the rule, the incident and the way out.

## Recipe 9: Deny a git write that does not name its directory

Shipped in `scripts/validate_git_command.py` as `git_write_without_named_dir()` (PreToolUse, Bash). `cd` survives between tool calls, so a `git commit`, `push`, `reset`, `rebase`, `cherry-pick`, `worktree` or any other write that omits its directory runs wherever the previous call stopped — and in the wrong repository it does not fail, it succeeds there. The rule "every call names its directory" was written down and still lapsed under a long chain of commands: on 2026-09-03 a `git push` ran in a simulator checkout instead of the addon worktree, and only a branch that did not exist there kept it from pushing. Reads had an advisory for the same shape, delivered once per session; a write cannot afford a warning its author may not read, so writes are denied until they name where they run, with `git -C /abs/path …` or a `cd /abs/path &&` in the same scope (a `cd` inside a quoted payload counts, as it does for the advisory). Reads keep the advisory; sharper gates (blanket add, conflict markers) report first.

The write is found by scanning tokens rather than by one pattern, because a pattern that knew only `-c` missed `git --no-pager push` and one that required a statement separator missed `env X=1 git push`. Global options are skipped until the subcommand; `-C` and `--git-dir` among them count as naming the directory, but only with a real operand, since git reads `git -C "" push` as no directory change at all (checked against git 2.55.0). A `cd` likewise counts only with a real operand. `cd && git push` leaves the inherited directory in place; `cd -` does change it, to `$OLDPWD`, but names no directory the reader of the command can see, which is what the gate is asking for.

Quoting decides whether text is a command. A quoted run is blanked before the scan, so `git -C /r commit -m "fix git push"` is not read as a second, unnamed write. The exception is a payload a local shell will run: `bash -c 'git push'` is the write it looks like and is denied, while `bash -c 'cd /repo && git push'` passes because the `cd` is in the payload's own scope. `ssh host '…'` is deliberately not inspected — its working directory is on another machine, which is not what this gate is about.

A heredoc body is data, not a command. `cat > doc.md <<'EOF' … git commit … EOF` writes text ABOUT a commit; it makes none. Scanning it denied writing documentation, release notes and the gate's own test fixtures — the same false denial the harness-local ancestor of this gate produced, from the same cause. Bodies are blanked before the scan, with one exception that decides the rule: an UNQUOTED body expands, so a `$( … )` or backtick span inside one really does run and stays in, while the prose around it does not. In a quoted body nothing expands, so the whole body goes. The blanking is length-preserving, because the scan reasons about offsets when it looks backwards for a `cd`.

The same blind spot bit a harness-local attribution gate on the same day, in its other form: it read a `git commit` inside `bash -c '…'` as text and let an undisclosed commit through. Both are the one question — does this span reach a shell? — and a hook that answers it in one place should answer it in the other.

The escape hatch counts only where a shell would read it as an environment assignment, and only on the statement it prefixes: as a substring it disabled the gate from inside a commit message that merely named it (which the messages in this repository do), and as a whole-command test `DESTRUCTIVE_GIT_GATE_OFF=1 true; git push origin main` disabled it for a write the assignment never prefixed. That predicate is shared with `blanket_git_add()`, which had the same weakness.

Escape hatch, shared with the destructive-git gate: `DESTRUCTIVE_GIT_GATE_OFF=1`. Verify both directions: `python3 -m unittest discover -s scripts -p 'test_*.py'` denies `git push origin x` and passes `git -C /repo push origin x`.

## Anti-Patterns

| Anti-pattern | Why wrong | Fix |
|--------------|-----------|-----|
| Using `xargs` on stdin JSON | xargs splits on spaces; breaks paths with spaces | `{ read -r F; ... "$F"; }` pattern |
| Forgetting `2>/dev/null \|\| true` on PostToolUse | Hook failure pollutes transcript | Wrap non-blocking hooks |
| `Write\|Edit` matcher without file-path extraction | Hook runs on wrong files | `jq -r '.tool_input.file_path'` |
| Blocking hooks that hit flaky services | One GitHub-API outage blocks all merges | Soft-fail: warn instead of deny for infra-dependent gates |
| Per-hook large shell scripts inline in JSON | Unreadable, un-testable | Keep inline ≤3 lines; call external script for more |
| An exception the gate reads from the environment | The hook is its own process; a `VAR=1 cmd` prefix never reaches it, so the documented way out is inert | Read it off the command text, anchored as a leading assignment, and copy the mechanism from the gate already shipping in that hook |
| A deny text whose promises nothing tests | The message is the contract; an untested promise is usually the case the gate gets wrong | One test per clause of the message — see below |
| A gate that scans a heredoc body | A body is data unless it expands; scanning it denies writing any document that mentions the command | Blank the body, length-preserving, keeping `$( … )` spans in an unquoted one |
| A gate built from an incident that covers one command shape | An incident is plural; the shape you remember is rarely the only one it used | Extract every command shape from the transcript and assert the predicate on each |

### The deny message is a specification

Whatever a denial says is what its author will be held to, and the exception
a message carves out is the case most likely to be wrong — it is the one the
implementation had to think about separately. Turn each clause into a test
before shipping the gate.

The forge-body language gate is the worked example. Its first message made
three claims, and the gate honoured one of them:

| Clause of the message | Test | First version |
|---|---|---|
| a German body is denied | German prose → `deny` | held |
| quoting a German string inside an English body "is fine" | English body with a German stack trace → not `deny` | denied it |
| `FORGE_LANGUAGE_GATE_OFF=1` exempts a German repository | the documented command verbatim → not `deny` | inert: read from the environment, which a Bash prefix never reaches |

Both failures were found by writing the tests from the message rather than
from the implementation. A fourth clause — that the exemption is a prefix and
not a mention — entered the message only with the fix, which is itself the
pattern: sharpening a promise is how the missing case gets named, so
re-derive the tests whenever the message changes.

A gate that denies also needs its threshold calibrated against a negative
corpus wider than the documents that motivated it. In that gate a German
function-word marker list contained `mit`, which is the licence every skill
repository names. A false deny blocks legitimate work, so in a denying gate a
marker that fires on the negative corpus is worse than a missing one — and
the calibration belongs in a test rather than a comment, because a marker
list is a decision and a comment cannot fail when the decision is reversed.
