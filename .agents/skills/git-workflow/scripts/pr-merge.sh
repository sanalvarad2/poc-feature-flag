# pr-merge.sh — merge a pull request with the method the repository allows,
# and only when the merge gate is actually open.
#
# Why this exists: `gh pr merge --merge --delete-branch` is wrong in two common
# repository configurations and gives no useful error until it fails. A repo
# with `allow_merge_commit: false` answers "Merge commits are not allowed on
# this repository"; a repo with a merge queue answers "Cannot use --delete-branch
# when merge queue enabled". Hand-rolling the detection per call site is how a
# 54-repository rollout hit both, three times each. pr-status.sh already knows
# the answer — this reads it instead of guessing.
#
# Squash is never used: it discards atomic commits and their signatures.
#
# Usage:
#   pr-merge.sh                       # PR for the current branch
#   pr-merge.sh 123
#   pr-merge.sh -R owner/repo 123
#   pr-merge.sh -R owner/repo 123 --dry-run   # print the command, run nothing
#   pr-merge.sh -R owner/repo 123 --self-reviewed
#                                     # the review the gate demands is one an
#                                     # exhausted Copilot quota (or two failed
#                                     # reviews on this head) makes
#                                     # unsatisfiable, and the operator has
#                                     # reviewed the diff instead: post the
#                                     # on-the-record `Self-review: <head-sha>`
#                                     # attestation comment as the PR author,
#                                     # then merge. Refused whenever a live
#                                     # review path still exists, and whenever
#                                     # the authenticated gh user is not the
#                                     # PR author (#203).
#
# Exit codes: 0 merged (or queued) AND confirmed by reading the PR back, 1 the
# gate is shut and nothing was attempted, 2 an error — usage, lookup, the merge
# call itself failed, or it exited 0 while nothing merged and nothing entered
