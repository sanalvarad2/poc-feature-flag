# pr-status.sh — one-shot, complete merge-readiness picture for a pull request,
# plus the next valid action.
#
# Why this exists: `mergeStateStatus: BLOCKED` never says *why*. Discovering the
# reason one API call at a time (checks, then rulesets, then threads, then the
# allowed merge methods, then the queue) burns round-trips and still misses
# gates — in one 40-PR rollout, 183 of 370 shell calls were PR-status probing,
# the rulesets endpoint was queried exactly once, and `copilot_code_review`
# blocked four merges by surprise.
#
# Two API calls on the green path: one GraphQL document for the PR, its
# checks, reviews, threads and the repository's merge configuration; one REST
# call for the effective branch rules (which is the only place rulesets show
# up). A review-blocked PR costs a third, admin-only call for classic branch
# protection, whose review gates (require_last_push_approval, approval count,
# code-owner reviews) no other endpoint exposes.
#
# Usage:
#   pr-status.sh                      # PR for the current branch
#   pr-status.sh 123                  # PR number in the current repo
#   pr-status.sh -R owner/repo 123
#   pr-status.sh --json               # machine-readable, no prose
#   pr-status.sh --watch              # return on the FIRST actionable event
#   pr-status.sh --watch --ignore-action request-review
#                                     # hold through a standing action you have
#                                     # decided not to take (repeatable)
#
# --watch deliberately does not wait for every check to finish. It returns as
# soon as something can be worked on: a failing check, a new annotation, or all
# required checks concluded. Waiting for `pending == 0` means learning nothing
# until the slowest matrix job ends, long after the first failure was visible.
#
# --ignore-action exists for the standing state the first-event rule cannot
# serve (#165): when `.next.action` is already actionable at invocation and
# retrying cannot clear it — a request-review made unsatisfiable by an
# exhausted Copilot quota — every re-arm of --watch returns the same line
# within a second, and the watch cannot be used to wait for anything else.
# Naming that action holds the watch through it: the watch still returns on
# every OTHER actionable event, and once the checks settle while NEXT still
# names the ignored action it returns `SETTLED: NEXT is still the ignored
# action` (exit 0) instead of idling into the timeout. A new check failure
# still returns, except when the ignored action IS the CI action
# (fix-ci/triage-ci).
#
# Copilot review quota
#
# The quota is per ACCOUNT and per MONTH, but the only evidence a single pull
# request carries is an errored review body on its own head — a PR nobody ever
# requested a review on carries none at all, and used to be answered with a
# re-request command the exhausted quota rejects. So the wall proven on one PR
# is written to ${XDG_CACHE_HOME:-~/.cache}/pr-status/, one file per calendar
# month, and every later invocation reads it before offering that command.
# The month lives in the FILENAME, so a marker from an earlier month is ignored
# rather than carried over the reset; delete the file to undo the effect.
#
# When the wall stands, the documented fallback (review the diff yourself,
# note it in the PR, decide) can be put on the record so the merge gate reads
# it back: a PR comment BY THE PR AUTHOR containing the line
# `Self-review: <head-sha>` (at least the first 12 chars). The ladder honours it
# ONLY while the demanded bot review is unsatisfiable — quota wall, or two
# failed reviews on this head — and the attestation dies with the next push,
# because the sha stops matching. `pr-merge.sh --self-reviewed` posts the
# comment and merges in one step. This is an explicit operator assertion the
# tool reads back, not a state it claims to observe (#203).
#
# --json contract
#
# One object, and its field names are THIS SCRIPT'S — not the GraphQL names
# `gh pr view` uses. `mergeState`, not `mergeStateStatus`. `base`, not
# `baseRefName`. Guessing costs more than reading: jq answers a missing key
# with `null` and says nothing, so a loop waiting for
# `.mergeStateStatus == "CLEAN"` never fires and reads as "still running"
# forever. Top-level keys:
#
#   state mergeable mergeState draft number title repo author author_is_bot
#   base head headOid
#   checks checks_settled threads unresolved_threads
#   unanswered_comments unanswered_human unanswered_by unanswered_urls
#   reviewDecision reviews_on_head has_review_on_head
#   has_copilot_review_on_head copilot_latest_on_head_ok copilot_review_errored
#   copilot_error_count copilot_quota_hit copilot_quota_exhausted
#   self_review_on_head self_review_url
#   requested_reviewers
#   merge_methods auto_merge_allowed queue_active queue_entry
#   rulesets rules_fetched required_contexts undispatched unsigned
#   classic_protection
#   next
#
# `checks` is {total,pass,fail,pending,skip,...} and `next` is
# {action,why,cmd} — the same two things the prose rendering leads with.
#
# Before writing a jq filter against any of these, consider whether --watch
# already answers the question; it usually does, and a hand-rolled poll loop is
# how the wrong field name gets guessed in the first place.
#
# tests/test_pr_status_json_contract.sh fails when this list and the emitted
# object drift apart, in either direction.
