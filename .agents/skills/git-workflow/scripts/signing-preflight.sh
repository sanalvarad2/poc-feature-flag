# signing-preflight.sh — does `git commit -S` actually produce a signature here?
#
# Answers the one question a commit-heavy run needs answered up front, and
# answers it from the commit object rather than from local verification:
#
#   git log --show-signature / %G?  →  "can THIS MACHINE verify the signature"
#   gpgsig header in the object     →  "did git WRITE a signature"
#
# Those differ. With gpg.format=ssh and no gpg.ssh.allowedSignersFile, git
# 2.54.0 reports `%G? = N` and `No signature` for a perfectly signed commit —
# indistinguishable from unsigned, and it exits 0 while printing the error, so
# a driver reading $? sees success. Whether the *host* accepts the key is a
# third question again, answered only by the GitHub commits API.
#
# The probe never touches the working tree, the index or the current branch:
# it commits on a throwaway branch through a temporary index and removes both.
#
# Usage: signing-preflight.sh [--config-only] [--check-commit <rev>]
#                             [--repo <dir>] [--quiet]
#
#   (default)         probe: prove that `git commit -S` signs, here, now
#   --config-only     report the signing config without creating a commit
#   --check-commit    report whether an existing commit carries a signature
#
# Exit codes:
#   0  READY / signed
#   1  NOT READY / unsigned — no signature, or the commit aborted with hooks
#                     already ruled out by the --no-verify retry
#   2  INCONCLUSIVE — --config-only cannot answer from the config alone
#   3  USAGE        — not a git repository / bad arguments

# --version answers "which copy am I running" without diffing installations.
# Two installations can declare the SAME number while shipping different
# scripts (netresearch/git-workflow-skill#209 measured exactly that, and the
# missing flag read as a missing feature for a dozen merges). So the resolved
# path is printed beside the version: the number says what the copy claims to
# be, the path says which file actually answered.
#
# The version is read from the SKILL.md NEXT TO the script, never from a
# checkout elsewhere -- a cached copy must report the number it was packaged
# with, or the answer is worse than none. \042 and \047 are the quote
# characters by octal code, so this awk program contains no quote of its own
